# Down-the-Rabbit-Hole

This is a Gameboy Advance game that I made for class. It's based on one of my favorite game series, American McGee's Alice. The objective is to collect the bottles in each of the 3 levels. The levels get more difficult, of course. The bottles may appear to hard-to-reach locations, which is why Alice must use the "rabbit holes" (or rather, the gaps in the ground) to fall through the screen and get to those places.

I made this game in C.
